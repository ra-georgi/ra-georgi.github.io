* Selection of Quadcopter components from several options is posed as a multi-objective optimization problem subject to performance and integration constraints
* Aimed to create a tool to aid hobbyists in selection of components for their quadcopter 
* Constraints consider manoeuvrability, current drawn by motors, frame size in relation to propellers, ESCâ€™s maximum voltage rating and takes input from users for constraints related to Figure of Merit and hovering capability
* Developed MATLAB app for users to provide data and to visualize results, including the Pareto frontier which displays Pareto optimal solutions. 
* For more information and tests with sample data, please see the report included in the Github page
