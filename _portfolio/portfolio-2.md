* Restores the manipulator to a predefined safe joint-target ("Home Position") using collision free paths generated by Moveit2 before starting production or for continuing assembly after an error. 
* Uses socket communication to first retrieve the current joint angles of the manipulator before sending joint targets based on trajectories generated by MoveIt. 
* STEP or STL files of the work environment is required to create the planning scene for MoveIt path planning.
