I'm a robotics engineer with 3 years of work experience at my current company [Simelabs](https://www.simelabs.com/services/robotics/) (a subsidiary of the Astek Group) where I've been working on navigation and robotic manipulation. I had previously graduated with a Master's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Purdue University where I majored in Autonomy and Control. During my studies, I have also had the opportunity to intern/work at Khalifa University, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and AbbVie. 

My Interests
======

My experience and interests centre around classical and learning based techniques of 3 major aspects of autonomous systems: Control, Planning and Perception. Developments in these areas have huge potential to transform every industry from transportation to consumer appliances and I am excited about tackling these challenges without compromising on the discipline required for developing safety critical systems. 

<!-- However, I wish to do so with the discipline, as advanced robotics application will often involve involve/interact human beings/life and hope to gain more expertise in this regards from experts/experienced engineers/practitioners who have experience in deploying safety critical systems -->

My interest in robotics evolved out of an interest in control systems which gave me the mathematical base to understand the algorithms used in other aspects of autonomous systems such as SLAM and perception. Take a look at the portfolion section where I have implemented some of these techniques. I try to implement these algorithms myself to keep track of their assumptions, benefits and drawbacks so that I have them in my "toolbox" when faced with a novel engineering problem.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge. -->
